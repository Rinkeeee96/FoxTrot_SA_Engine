You can remeber the first thing that happend; you were testing the game that you have made with your buddies for the minor software architecture 
 
This region seems to be one of the regions that was in the game

It seems that there is a next region, the desert! This is exactly how you have made it. 
 
There is something weird about it though.

Bob; It seems that the next region is going to be harder to beat. And things are getting glitchy
 
*sigh* Why did you have to make the game so hard..... 
 
Let's go to the next region
