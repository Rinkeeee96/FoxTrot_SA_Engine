You woke up in a mysterious world and have no idea where you are... 
 
You hear a voice ... ... ... 
 
...

Ah it's Bob, Bob van der Putten! 
 
You remember Bob from the great lessons he lectured on the Avans. 
 
You asked Bob what happend and say you don't remember a thing. 
 
The last thing you remember is that the were working on your minor, developing a fantastic game. 
 
Bob; Unfortunately I can't remember a thing either, I have been here for a bit longer and did some reconnaissance. Strange things happen in this world! 
 
Lets work together to get out of here!  
 
Lets start with the first region!
